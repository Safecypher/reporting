# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-18)

**Core value:** Trustworthy revenue reconciliation — billing must equal verifications, and any discrepancy must be immediately visible and traceable to source.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — End-to-End Spine

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (End-to-End Spine)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-18 — Roadmap created (4 phases, coarse granularity, MVP mode)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: MVP resolved as correctness-first — Phase 1 is a thin end-to-end vertical slice (auth + upload + verification report fully de-duplicated + one view) that bakes the correctness foundation into the schema, rather than a horizontal schema-only phase.
- [Roadmap]: Phases 2 (six parsers) and 3–4 (views) structured to exploit the two parallel fan-out points identified in research.
- [Roadmap]: Billing-vs-verification discrepancy flagging (Phase 4) is the demo centrepiece / core-value milestone.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Carried from research (resolve during phase planning):

- [Phase 2] De-dup composite key for verification/dCVV is a business decision — confirm with Joachim whether two same-second verifications of one card are possible; retain raw staging so the key is re-tunable.
- [Phase 2] Source timezone per report type must be established (not guessed) before finalising UTC normalisation — confirm with Joachim/Chris; store raw timestamp strings.
- [Phase 3] MSA pricing tiers not yet received (Richard) — use configurable placeholder tiers; validate bracket contiguity/ordering.
- [Phase 4] 6am/8am billing/others delivery offset — design reconciliation to tolerate the offset regardless of Joachim's alignment effort; event-timestamp + settling window.
